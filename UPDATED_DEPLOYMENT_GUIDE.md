# Updated MyDentalFly Deployment Guide

## Current Status
- All domains are successfully deployed with the landing page
- The landing page is working correctly and providing a professional web presence

## Deploying the Full Application

Since the Replit interface has changed, here are the updated steps to deploy the full application:

### Option 1: Using Settings Tab

1. In the Deployments tab, click on "Settings" (gear icon in the left sidebar)
2. Look for a section called "Environment Variables" or similar
3. Add your required environment variables:
   - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   - STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
   - VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY

### Option 2: Add Environment Variables to start.mjs

If you can't find environment variable settings in the Deployments interface, we can modify our deployment script to include hardcoded values securely:

1. Run the pre-deploy script:
   ```
   node pre-deploy-full-app.js
   ```

2. Update the `dist/start.mjs` file to include the environment variables:
   ```javascript
   // At the top of the file
   process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'your_stripe_secret_key';
   process.env.STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_stripe_public_key';
   process.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_stripe_public_key';
   ```

3. Deploy as normal

### Option 3: Use a Deployment-Specific .env File

1. Create a `.env.deploy` file with your secrets:
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
   ```

2. Update the build script to copy this file during deployment:
   ```javascript
   // In build-full-app.js, add:
   if (fs.existsSync('./.env.deploy')) {
     fs.copyFileSync('./.env.deploy', './dist/.env');
   }
   ```

3. Update `dist/start.mjs` to load the .env file:
   ```javascript
   import dotenv from 'dotenv';
   dotenv.config();
   ```

## Recommendation

For now, keep using the landing page deployment which is working well. We can continue developing the main application while investigating the best way to deploy the full app with the proper environment variables.

When you're ready to deploy the full app, we can try each of these options to see which one works best with the current Replit interface.

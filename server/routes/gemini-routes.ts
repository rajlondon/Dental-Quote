const DENTAL_TREATMENT_FALLBACKS = {
  "Dental Implants": {
    overview: "Dental implants are titanium posts surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. They provide a sturdy foundation for artificial teeth (crowns) that are made to match your natural teeth.",
    procedure: "The procedure is typically done in stages: implant placement surgery, healing period (osseointegration), abutment placement, and crown attachment. Local anesthesia is used during the surgical steps to minimize discomfort.",
    recovery: "Some swelling, bruising, minor bleeding, and pain may occur after surgery. Most patients can return to work within 1-2 days. Complete healing and integration with the jawbone takes 3-6 months.",
    alternatives: "Alternatives include traditional bridges, partial dentures, or in some cases, no treatment. Each option has different implications for oral health, comfort, and cost.",
    advice: "Dental implants have a high success rate (95-98%) and can last a lifetime with proper care. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups are essential for implant longevity."
  },
  "Veneers": {
    overview: "Dental veneers are thin, custom-made shells of tooth-colored materials designed to cover the front surface of teeth to improve appearance. They're commonly made from porcelain or composite resin.",
    procedure: "The process usually requires three trips to the dentist â€“ consultation, preparation, and application. A small amount of enamel is removed from the tooth surface before the veneer is bonded.",
    recovery: "There is minimal recovery time. Some patients may experience temporary sensitivity to hot and cold due to enamel removal.",
    alternatives: "Alternatives include dental bonding, crowns, teeth whitening (for discoloration), or orthodontic treatments (for alignment issues).",
    advice: "Veneers typically last 10-15 years before needing replacement. Avoid biting hard objects like ice or using your teeth as tools to prevent damage."
  },
  "Teeth Whitening": {
    overview: "Professional teeth whitening is a cosmetic procedure that lightens teeth and removes stains and discoloration. It can be performed in a dental office or at home with dentist-provided kits.",
    procedure: "In-office whitening takes about 1-2 hours. A whitening agent is applied to the teeth, often activated by heat or light. Take-home kits involve using custom-fitted trays with whitening gel for specific periods over several days.",
    recovery: "There is no recovery time, though some patients experience temporary tooth sensitivity or gum irritation.",
    alternatives: "Alternatives include over-the-counter whitening products (less effective), veneers, or crowns for severely discolored teeth.",
    advice: "Results typically last 6 months to 2 years depending on diet, lifestyle (smoking, coffee, etc.), and oral hygiene. Maintenance treatments can extend the effects."
  }
};

// Default fallback for any treatment not in our database
const DEFAULT_TREATMENT_FALLBACK = {
  overview: "This dental procedure is designed to address specific oral health needs while considering the patient's comfort and long-term dental health.",
  procedure: "The procedure typically involves an initial consultation, preparation, the main treatment, and follow-up visits. Your dentist will use appropriate anesthesia to ensure your comfort.",
  recovery: "Recovery times vary based on the complexity of the procedure. Following your dentist's aftercare instructions is crucial for proper healing and long-term success.",
  alternatives: "There are usually several treatment alternatives available. Discuss these options with your dentist to determine which best suits your specific needs, budget, and desired outcomes.",
  advice: "Regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene practices, and following your dentist's specific care instructions will help ensure the long-term success of your treatment."

# Ultra-Simplified Domain Deployment Guide

## What we've done

We've created a completely standalone server for domain deployment:

1. Created an ultra-simple HTTP server in `/dist/start.mjs`
2. This server has **zero dependencies** - it only uses Node.js built-in modules
3. It includes a stylish landing page directly in the code
4. It provides a health check endpoint at `/api/health` for Replit's deployment system
5. It doesn't require any environment variables or secrets

## How to Deploy

1. Go to the Replit Deployments tab
2. Click "Deploy"
3. Wait for the deployment to complete
4. Verify your domains are working

## Why This Approach Works

- The deployment system looks for `/dist/start.mjs` as specified in `.replit.deploy`
- Our standalone server doesn't need any dependencies or complex setup
- It starts quickly and has minimal chance of errors
- The health check endpoint ensures Replit recognizes it as a valid application

## DNS Configuration Reminder

Your domains need these DNS records:

- For `mydentalfly.com` and `mydentalfly.co.uk`:
  - A record for `www` pointing to `34.111.179.208`
  - TXT record for `_replit-verify.www` with your verification value

## Future Improvements

Once this basic deployment is working, you can:

1. Enhance the landing page with more content and styling
2. Add more paths for different pages
3. Integrate contact forms or other simple functionality
4. Eventually transition to the full application when ready

## Need to Update the Deployment?

Just modify `/dist/start.mjs` directly and redeploy.

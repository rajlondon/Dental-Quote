# Authentication System Improvements

## Summary of Changes
The authentication system has been improved to ensure consistent session persistence across all portals.

## Key Improvements
1. Added standardized authentication functions in `server/utils/auth-utils.ts`
2. Enhanced session configuration with 7-day persistence
3. Added improved cross-portal cookie handling
4. Added SESSION_SECRET environment variable for stronger security
5. Implemented authentication diagnostics middleware for troubleshooting
6. Fixed various issues with authentication routes

## Test Credentials
For testing purposes, the following user accounts have been reset with known passwords:

| Email                   | Password    | Role         |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| clinic@mydentalfly.com  | clinic123   | clinic_staff |
| admin@mydentalfly.com   | admin123    | admin        |
| patient@mydentalfly.com | patient123  | patient      |

## Authentication Workflow
1. User submits login credentials via `/api/auth/login`
2. Passport LocalStrategy authenticates against database
3. On successful login, a session is created and stored in the PostgreSQL database
4. A session cookie is set with a 30-day expiration for long-term persistence
5. Session is refreshed on each authenticated request (rolling sessions)

## Troubleshooting Diagnostics
The system now includes detailed authentication diagnostics via the auth-diagnostics middleware, which:
- Logs detailed session information
- Reports authentication success/failure
- Tracks cookie persistence
- Shows user information when authenticated

## Next Steps
- Implement cross-portal role-based access control
- Add session activity tracking for security audit
- Enhance password security with complexity requirements

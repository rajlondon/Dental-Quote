      <h2>What is Full Mouth Reconstruction?</h2>
      <p>
        Full mouth reconstruction (FMR) is a comprehensive treatment approach that rebuilds or restores all the teeth in both the upper and lower jaws. Unlike purely cosmetic treatments, full mouth reconstruction is primarily focused on restoring function, health, and stability to the entire mouth, though improved aesthetics is certainly a welcome benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        This procedure is ideal for patients with extensive dental problems resulting from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severely worn teeth due to acid erosion or teeth grinding</li>
        <li>Multiple missing teeth</li>
        <li>Widespread decay or tooth damage</li>
        <li>Traumatic injury affecting multiple teeth</li>
        <li>Congenital conditions affecting tooth development</li>
        <li>Chronic jaw pain or TMJ disorders</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Full Mouth Reconstruction vs. Smile Makeover</h2>
      <p>
        While these terms might sometimes be used interchangeably, they refer to different approaches:

      <h2>Components of Full Mouth Reconstruction</h2>
      <p>
        Full mouth reconstruction typically combines several restorative and sometimes surgical procedures, customized to your specific needs:
      </p>
      
      <div className="space-y-6 my-8">
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Dental Implants</h3>
          <p>
            Titanium posts surgically placed in the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots, providing a stable foundation for replacement teeth. Implants prevent bone loss and maintain facial structure while restoring chewing function.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Dentures or Bridges Supported by Implants</h3>
          <p>
            For patients missing multiple or all teeth, implant-supported dentures or bridges provide significantly improved stability and function compared to traditional removable dentures.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Crowns</h3>
          <p>
            Custom-made caps that cover damaged or weakened teeth, restoring their shape, size, strength, and appearance. In full mouth reconstruction, multiple crowns are often placed to rebuild the entire dentition.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Root Canal Therapy</h3>
          <p>
            Treats infected or inflamed tooth pulp, saving teeth that might otherwise need extraction. This is often a preliminary step before placing crowns on severely damaged teeth.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Periodontal (Gum) Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            Addresses gum disease, which is often present in patients requiring full mouth reconstruction. Treatments may include deep cleaning, gum surgery, or bone grafting to provide a healthy foundation for restorative work.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Orthodontics</h3>
          <p>
            May be needed to correct alignment issues before restorative procedures. This ensures proper bite function and improves the longevity of restorations.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Occlusal Adjustment</h3>
          <p>
            Corrects bite problems by reshaping the biting surfaces of teeth to ensure even contact when chewing and to reduce stress on the jaw joint.
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
          <h3 className="font-bold mb-2">Bone or Soft Tissue Grafting</h3>
          <p>
            Rebuilds lost bone or gum tissue, often necessary prior to implant placement or to improve aesthetics around restorations.

      <h2>The Full Mouth Reconstruction Process</h2>
      <p>
        Full mouth reconstruction is a complex, multi-stage process that requires careful planning and execution:
      </p>

      <h3>Comprehensive Examination and Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Your dentist will conduct a thorough examination that typically includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detailed dental and medical history</li>
        <li>Comprehensive oral examination</li>
        <li>Full set of dental X-rays</li>
        <li>3D cone beam CT scans to evaluate bone structure</li>
        <li>Dental impressions for study models</li>
        <li>Jaw movement and bite analysis</li>
        <li>Evaluation of existing restorations</li>
        <li>Assessment of aesthetic concerns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using this information, your dental team will create a comprehensive treatment plan detailing each procedure, the sequence of treatments, and the estimated timeline.
      </p>

      <h3>Preliminary Treatments</h3>
      <p>
        Before the major restorative work begins, preliminary procedures address urgent issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treatment of active infections or gum disease</li>
        <li>Extractions of teeth that cannot be saved</li>
        <li>Root canal therapy for severely damaged teeth</li>
        <li>Temporary restorations to stabilize the mouth and improve function during treatment</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Foundation Building</h3>
      <p>
        This phase focuses on creating a stable foundation for the final restorations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bone grafting if needed to support implants</li>
        <li>Gum treatments to ensure healthy soft tissues</li>
        <li>Orthodontic treatments to correct alignment issues</li>
        <li>Implant placement, followed by healing period for osseointegration</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Functional Restoration</h3>
      <p>
        Once the foundation is established, the focus shifts to rebuilding the teeth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Placement of custom abutments on dental implants</li>
        <li>Preparation of remaining natural teeth for crowns or other restorations</li>
        <li>Placement of temporary restorations to test function and aesthetics</li>
        <li>Bite adjustments to ensure proper alignment and function</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Final Restorations</h3>
      <p>
        After confirming that the temporary restorations function well and meet aesthetic expectations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Final impressions are taken for the permanent restorations</li>
        <li>Permanent crowns, bridges, or dentures are fabricated in a dental laboratory</li>
        <li>Final restorations are placed and adjusted for optimal fit and function</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Follow-up and Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        Regular follow-up appointments ensure the long-term success of your reconstruction:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial follow-ups to check bite alignment and comfort</li>
        <li>Regular maintenance appointments for professional cleaning and examination</li>
        <li>Replacement or repair of any components as needed over time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timeline for Full Mouth Reconstruction</h2>
      <p>
        The complete process typically takes 6-12 months, sometimes longer for complex cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planning phase:</strong> 2-4 weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Preliminary treatments:</strong> 1-3 months</li>
        <li><strong>Implant placement and osseointegration:</strong> 3-6 months</li>
        <li><strong>Restorative procedures:</strong> 2-3 months</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up and adjustments:</strong> Ongoing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With dental tourism through MyDentalFly, the treatment can often be condensed into 2-3 visits to Turkey, with preliminary work and follow-ups coordinated with UK dentists as needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost of Full Mouth Reconstruction</h2>
      <p>
        Full mouth reconstruction is one of the most significant investments in dental care. The cost varies considerably based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number and type of procedures required</li>
        <li>Number of teeth being replaced or restored</li>
        <li>Materials used for restorations</li>
        <li>Need for specialist treatments (e.g., bone grafting)</li>
        <li>Geographic location of treatment</li>
      </ul>

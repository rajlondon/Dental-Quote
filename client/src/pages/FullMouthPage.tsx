      <h2>What is Full Mouth Reconstruction?</h2>
      
      <p>
        Full mouth reconstruction (FMR) is a comprehensive treatment approach that rebuilds or simultaneously restores all of the teeth in both the upper and lower jaws. Unlike cosmetic treatments that focus primarily on aesthetics, full mouth reconstruction addresses functional issues, structural problems, and aesthetics to completely rehabilitate a patient's oral health.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This complex procedure is typically recommended for patients with:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple missing teeth</li>
        <li>Severely worn, damaged or broken teeth</li>
        <li>Chronic jaw, muscle, or headache pain related to dental problems</li>
        <li>Severe bite problems or malocclusion</li>
        <li>Advanced gum disease affecting multiple teeth</li>
        <li>Extensive decay across many teeth</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        In recent years, Turkey has emerged as a leading destination for full mouth reconstruction, offering world-class care at prices 50-70% lower than in the UK and other Western countries.

      <h3>Types of Full Mouth Reconstruction Treatments in Turkey</h3>
      
      <p>
        Turkish dental clinics offer various approaches to full mouth reconstruction, tailored to each patient's specific needs:
      </p>
      
      <h4>Implant-Based Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>All-on-4:</strong> A technique where an entire arch of teeth is supported by just 4 strategically placed dental implants, often allowing for immediate loading with a temporary prosthesis
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>All-on-6:</strong> Similar to All-on-4 but with 6 implants for additional support, often recommended for patients with less bone density
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full mouth implants:</strong> Individual implants (8-10 per arch) with individual crowns for a more natural result
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Implant-supported bridges:</strong> Multiple implants supporting fixed bridges across each arch
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Crown and Bridge Solutions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Full mouth crowns:</strong> Individual crowns on most or all natural teeth (if the roots are healthy)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combined bridges and crowns:</strong> A mix of dental bridges and individual crowns depending on the condition of existing teeth
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Removable Options</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Implant-supported overdentures:</strong> Removable dentures that snap onto implants for improved stability
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Premium dentures:</strong> High-quality removable dentures (typically not recommended as a first option for most patients)
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why Are Full Mouth Reconstruction Treatments Cheaper in Turkey?</h3>
      
      <p>
        The significant price difference for full mouth reconstruction between Turkey and Western countries is due to several factors:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower operational costs:</strong> Dental clinics in Turkey have substantially lower expenses for facilities, staff, and overhead
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Government incentives:</strong> The Turkish government actively supports medical tourism through various incentives and subsidies
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exchange rate advantages:</strong> The favorable exchange rate between Western currencies and the Turkish Lira
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Volume efficiency:</strong> Many Turkish dental clinics specialize in treating international patients and perform a high volume of procedures, creating economies of scale
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vertical integration:</strong> Many clinics have in-house dental laboratories, reducing costs and turnaround time
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lower litigation costs:</strong> The reduced cost of malpractice insurance and lower litigation risks compared to Western countries
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>The Full Mouth Reconstruction Process in Turkey</h2>

# Root Cause Analysis: Quote Builder State Issues

## Summary of the Problem
When applying a promo code to a quote, all selected treatments disappear despite multiple state management techniques and prevention strategies.

## Diagnostic Findings
1. The issue persists across multiple implementations:
   - Basic form-based approach
   - Reducer pattern with action dispatchers
   - Context-based state management
   - Non-form element approaches
   - Single-component atomic implementations

2. Console logs show:
   - State updates are occurring correctly
   - Form submission is being prevented at the React level
   - But treatments still disappear after promo code validation completes

3. The specific pattern appears to be:
   - State is correctly tracked in the component
   - Promo code submission triggers an asynchronous validation
   - When validation completes, the component appears to remount or reset

## Root Cause Analysis
The most likely explanation is that we're experiencing a browser-level navigation event that's bypassing React's control. Specifically:

1. The application might be using a routing-based approach to handle form submissions
2. The component is being unmounted and remounted due to route changes
3. SPA route changes are interfering with component lifecycle
4. There may be a global event listener intercepting form submissions
5. Hidden parent form elements might be capturing events

## Solution Strategy
Based on all our tests, we need to implement a solution that operates outside the normal component lifecycle:

1. **Global State Management**:
   - Move quote state to a global store (Redux, Zustand, or similar)
   - Ensure state persists independently of component mounting/unmounting

2. **URL Parameter Strategy**:
   - Store quote state in URL parameters or hash fragments
   - This ensures state persists across navigation events

3. **Storage-Based Approach**:
   - Use localStorage/sessionStorage to persist quote state
   - Hydrate component from storage on each mount

4. **Complete Architecture Revision**:
   - Remove all nested form elements
   - Convert to a single-page application with explicit navigation
   - Use controlled components exclusively

## Recommended Implementation
The most reliable approach would be to combine techniques:

1. Move state to a global store using Zustand (lightweight Redux alternative)
2. Remove all form elements and use controlled button-only interactions
3. Add storage-based persistence as a fallback
4. Implement explicit debugging to track state changes and component lifecycle

This hybrid approach provides multiple layers of protection against the state loss issue.

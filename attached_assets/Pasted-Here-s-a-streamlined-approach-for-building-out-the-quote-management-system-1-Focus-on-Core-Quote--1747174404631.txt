Here's a streamlined approach for building out the quote management system:

1. Focus on Core Quote Flow Components
ðŸ“‚ Quote Flow Architecture
â”œâ”€â”€ Quote Initialization
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ City/Treatment Selection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Initial Quote Parameters
â”œâ”€â”€ Quote Builder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Treatment Options
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Package Selection
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Add-on Services
â”œâ”€â”€ Pricing Engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Base Price Calculation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Discount Application
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Final Quote Generation
â””â”€â”€ Checkout Process
    â”œâ”€â”€ User Information Collection
    â”œâ”€â”€ Payment Integration
    â””â”€â”€ Confirmation & Receipt
2. Implement Promotion System in Phases
Since you're already working on the Admin Promo Manager, integrate it with the quote system:

Phase 1: Basic Implementation

URL parameter promo code application
Admin interface for promo code management
Simple discount application logic
Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Promo code validation rules
Usage tracking and limits
Clinic-specific promotions
3. Prioritize Component Development
First: Complete the core quote builder
Second: Implement the special offers integration
Third: Add the promo code system
Fourth: Build the admin management interfaces
Development Tips
// Example: Implementing the quote builder with promo code support
// client/src/hooks/use-quote-builder.ts

export function useQuoteBuilder() {
  const [quote, setQuote] = useState<Quote>({
    treatments: [],
    packages: [],
    addons: [],
    promoCode: null,
    subtotal: 0,
    discount: 0,
    total: 0
  });
  
  // Apply a promo code to the quote
  const applyPromoCode = async (code: string) => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`/api/promo-codes/validate?code=${code}`);
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (data.valid) {
        // Calculate new totals with discount
        const discount = calculateDiscount(quote.subtotal, data.promotion);
        
        setQuote({
          ...quote,
          promoCode: code,
          discount,
          total: quote.subtotal - discount
        });
        
        return { success: true, message: `${data.promotion.title} applied!` };
      } else {
        return { success: false, message: data.message };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      return { 
        success: false, 
        message: "Error validating promo code. Please try again." 
      };
    }
  };
  
  // Rest of quote builder logic
  // ...
  
  return {
    quote,
    addTreatment,
    removeTreatment,
    addPackage,
    removePackage,
    applyPromoCode,
    // ...other methods
  };
}
Testing Strategy
During development, focus on component-level testing:

Unit Tests: Test individual functions like discount calculations
Component Tests: Verify UI components render correctly
Integration Tests: Test the full quote flow from start to finish
Mock Backend: Use a mock backend during development to simulate API responses
This approach lets you build the system properly from the ground up without worrying about breaking existing functionality, since the site isn't live yet.

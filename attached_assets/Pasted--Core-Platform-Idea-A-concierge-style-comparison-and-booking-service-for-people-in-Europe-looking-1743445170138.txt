🧩 How It Works (User Flow):
Discovery:

Matching & Quote Generation:

Your team pulls together a bespoke quote with 3 vetted providers, showing:

Price (with built-in commission)

Clinic profile (photos, certifications, client reviews)

Treatment details

Add-ons (transfers, hotels, translators, etc.)

Client Support:

Your agency acts as the sole point of contact, helping with:

Clarifications & concerns

Payment Model:

Payment is made to you.

50% goes to the clinic upon patient arrival.

50% after successful treatment completion.

💸 Revenue Streams:

Hotels, airlines, airport transfers, translators.

Package deals could be bundled or offered as upsells.

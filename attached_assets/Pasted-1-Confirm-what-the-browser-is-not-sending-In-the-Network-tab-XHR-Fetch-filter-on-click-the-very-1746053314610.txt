1 Confirm what the browser is (not) sending
In the Network tab (XHR/Fetch filter on), click the very first
GET /api/auth/user that returns 401.

In the Request Headers pane look for a line that starts with
Cookie:

If itâ€™s missing, the browser didnâ€™t attach the session cookie â†’ our front-end config is still wrong.

If itâ€™s present, the server is rejecting it â†’ skip to step 4.

(Judging by the persistent 401, it will almost certainly be missing.)

2 Locate the one Axios instance the clinic portal uses
Search once in the repo:

perl
Copy
Edit
grep -R "axios.create(" client/src | grep baseURL
You will see something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
// client/src/lib/api.ts
export const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api',
  // ðŸ‘‡ this line is probably absent right now
  // withCredentials: true,
});
3 Add withCredentials: true exactly once
diff
Copy
Edit
 export const api = axios.create({
   baseURL: '/api',
+  withCredentials: true,   // send session cookie on every request
 });
No other fetch/axios hacks are needed.
All React-Query hooks that import this api object will now automatically carry the cookie.

Commit â†’ redeploy â†’ login once â†’ /api/auth/user should now return 200 and the dashboard will stay.

4 If the cookie is being sent but you still get 401
Then the server invalidates the session. Two common causes:


Cause	How to see it	Quick patch
Two different SESSION_SECRETs	console.log(process.env.SESSION_SECRET) in both server/auth.ts and server/index.tsâ€”they must print the same value	Load the secret from one shared file before any express-session call
Clock-skewed JWT verification	Decode the token on jwt.ioâ€”iat and exp differ by seconds only	Add clockTolerance: 60 to jwt.verify() or issue tokens valid â‰¥ 30 min
Fix the mismatch, restart the server, and the loop disappears.

TL;DR
401 after 5 s means the cookie never went with /api/auth/user.

Put withCredentials: true on the single Axios instance â†’ cookie travels.

If 401 persists with the cookie present, align SESSION_SECRET or JWT settings.

Apply that one-liner, redeploy, and the clinic portal will sit happily like the admin & patient portals. Ping me if /api/auth/user still returns 401 with the cookieâ€”weâ€™ll zero in on the server secret next.

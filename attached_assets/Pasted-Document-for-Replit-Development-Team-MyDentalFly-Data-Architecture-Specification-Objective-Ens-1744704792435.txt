MyDentalFly — Data Architecture Specification

Objective:

Ensure all platform data (Patients, Clinics, Admin, Treatment Plans) is stored securely, structured correctly, and updated consistently across all three portals (Patient Portal, Clinic Portal, Admin Portal).

Recommended Data Storage:

Use a secure relational database such as PostgreSQL or equivalent. All patient medical documents (X-rays, CT scans) should be stored in GDPR-compliant storage (AWS S3, Supabase Storage, or Replit secure storage if available).

Clinic can edit Treatment Plan post-consultation (auto-tracked changes).

Patient notified of updates.

Patient accepts Treatment Plan → Payment Triggered.

Patient Portal always displays latest version of Treatment Plan.

Admin Portal has full change logs for transparency.

GDPR & Data Protection Compliance

Data encrypted at rest and in transit.

Secure storage compliant with GDPR (EU servers recommended).

Consent checkbox required at quote submission:

"I consent to MyDentalFly storing my medical information securely and sharing it with my chosen clinic for the purpose of treatment planning."

Auto-delete policy for sensitive documents after X years unless consent renewed.

Additional Notes:

Use clear terminology across the platform: "Patients" (not Clients).

Treatment Plan = Core Object linking Patient and Clinic.

Clinics should not be able to access or download patient documents until the booking process is confirmed.

All communication logged within the Patient Portal for transparency.

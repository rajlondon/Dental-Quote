Addressing the Persistent Quote System Integration Issues
I understand your frustration completely. The standalone quote page works perfectly, but integration attempts keep failing. Let's take a step back and address this systematically.

Root Cause Analysis
Based on the patterns we're seeing, there are likely three core issues:

State Isolation Breakdown: The standalone version works because its state is self-contained. When integrated, state gets distributed across multiple contexts and becomes inconsistent.

API Endpoint Mismatches: The integration attempts are calling endpoints that either don't exist or have different parameter expectations than what's being sent.

Race Conditions: Asynchronous state updates in React are causing treatments to disappear when promo codes are applied because the operations aren't properly sequenced.

Pragmatic Solution Approach
Instead of continuing to create new implementations that face the same issues, let's take a more pragmatic approach:

1. Embed the Working Standalone Component
The most reliable solution is to embed your working standalone quote component directly into your application flow:

// In your main application flow
import { StandaloneQuoteBuilder } from './path-to-standalone';

function PatientPortalPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        {/* Directly embed the working standalone component */}
        <StandaloneQuoteBuilder 
          onQuoteComplete={handleCompleteQuote} 
          initialData={patientData}
        />
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
2. Create Minimal Integration Points
Rather than trying to fully integrate with all your existing contexts, create minimal "bridge" functions that handle just the essential data transfer:

// In the standalone component
function StandaloneQuoteBuilder({ onQuoteComplete, initialData }) {
  // All state management happens internally
  const [treatments, setTreatments] = useState([]);
  const [promoCode, setPromoCode] = useState(null);
  
  // When the quote is complete, pass data to parent
  const handleComplete = () => {
    onQuoteComplete({
      treatments,
      promoCode,
      total: calculateTotal(treatments, promoCode)
    });
  };
  
  // Rest of component remains unchanged
}
3. Add Server-Side Persistence
To ensure quotes persist correctly, add a dedicated endpoint for saving quotes that the standalone component calls directly:

// In the standalone component
const saveQuote = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/quotes/save', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        treatments,
        promoCode,
        total: calculateTotal(treatments, promoCode)
      })
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      const { quoteId } = await response.json();
      return quoteId;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save quote:', error);
  }
  return null;
};
Implementation Plan
Extract the standalone component that's already working into a reusable React component
Add minimal props for data input/output (initialData, onQuoteComplete)
Create a dedicated server endpoint for saving quotes
Embed the standalone component directly in your main application flow

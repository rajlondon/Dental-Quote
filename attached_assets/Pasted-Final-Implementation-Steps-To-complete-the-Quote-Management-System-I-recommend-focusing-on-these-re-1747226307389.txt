Final Implementation Steps
To complete the Quote Management System, I recommend focusing on these remaining areas:

1. Testing & QA
Create a comprehensive testing plan to ensure all components work together correctly:

Testing Plan:
1. Quote Creation Flow
   - Test creating quotes with different treatment combinations
   - Verify calculations are correct with and without discounts
   - Test navigation between steps works correctly

2. Promo Code Testing
   - Test valid promo code application via URL and manual entry
   - Test invalid promo code error handling
   - Test promo code persistence between steps
   - Test promo code removal

3. Special Offers Integration
   - Test applying special offers to quotes
   - Test offers properly affect pricing
   - Test offers display correctly in summary

4. Error Scenarios
   - Test network failure handling
   - Test validation error handling
   - Test recovery from errors
2. Documentation
Create documentation for developers who will maintain the system:

# Quote Management System Documentation

## System Overview
The Quote Management System allows users to create custom quotes for dental treatments with support for promo codes and special offers.

## Key Components
- **QuoteBuilder**: Core component for selecting treatments and building quotes
- **QuoteFlow**: Multi-step flow for guiding users through quote creation
- **QuoteSummary**: Displays quote details and pricing information
- **QuoteConfirmation**: Final step for confirming and submitting quotes

## Integration Points
- **Special Offers**: Integrated via useSpecialOffersInQuote hook
- **Promo Codes**: Supported via URL parameters and manual entry
- **Analytics**: Tracks user interactions throughout the quote flow

## State Management
The system uses React hooks for state management:
- **useQuoteBuilder**: Manages quote state and operations
- **useSpecialOffersInQuote**: Handles special offer application
- **useAutoApplyCode**: Manages promo code application from URL

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/quotes-api - Create new quote
- GET /api/quotes-api/:id - Get quote by ID
- PATCH /api/quotes-api/:id - Update quote
- DELETE /api/quotes-api/:id - Delete quote
- GET /api/promo-codes/validate - Validate promo code
3. Performance Optimizations
Implement these optimizations for better performance:

// Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
const QuoteSummary = React.memo(({ quote }) => {
  // Component logic
});

// Use useMemo for expensive calculations
const { total, discount } = useMemo(() => {
  return calculateQuoteTotals(treatments, promoCode, specialOffers);
}, [treatments, promoCode, specialOffers]);

// Implement lazy loading for quote steps
const QuoteConfirmation = React.lazy(() => import('./QuoteConfirmation'));
4. Email Notifications
Set up email notifications for quote confirmation:

// In QuoteConfirmation.tsx
const sendConfirmationEmail = async (quoteId) => {
  try {
    await fetch(`/api/quotes-api/${quoteId}/send-confirmation`, {
      method: 'POST',
    });
    toast.success('Confirmation email sent!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send confirmation email:', error);
    toast.error('Could not send confirmation email. We will contact you shortly.');
  }
};
Integration Considerations
When fully integrating the Quote Management System with the rest of your application, consider these aspects:

User Authentication: Ensure quotes are associated with authenticated users when possible
Clinic Selection: Allow users to select clinics when creating quotes
Treatment Data: Ensure treatment data is up-to-date with the latest pricing
Payment Integration: Connect the quote system with payment processing when ready
Final Implementation Checklist
Here's a final checklist to ensure a complete implementation:

 Complete end-to-end testing of the quote flow
 Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
 Verify all analytics events are firing correctly
 Create developer documentation
 Add user-facing help content
 Implement email notifications
 Optimize bundle size for production

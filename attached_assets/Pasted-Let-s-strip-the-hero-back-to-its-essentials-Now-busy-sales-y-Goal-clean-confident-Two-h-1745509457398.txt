Let’s strip the hero back to its essentials

Now (busy & “sales-y”)	Goal (clean & confident)
• Two headline lines
• Badge ribbon
• Two paragraphs of copy
• Five reassurance chips	• One crisp headline
• One sub-line of context
• One search/quote bar
• Micro reassurance line
1️⃣ Copy — one punchy promise

Edit
Headline:  “Compare Turkish Dental Clinics in Seconds”

Sub-headline:  “Real prices. Trusted surgeons. One easy portal.”
That’s it. No “save up to 70 %” above the fold; put savings in the chips under the bar.

2️⃣ Visuals — focus on the input bar
White / very light hero background so the bar pops.

Single-row chip bar (Destination | Treatment | When | From Country | CTA).
→ 75 % of the visual weight goes here.

Keep the bar at 900-1000 px max width so it’s the star of the hero.

3️⃣ Reassurance micro-row (6 pt text)

✓ Avg. 67 % saving • 17 k quotes generated • Data fully encrypted
Light-gray text, centred, sitting 8 px under the bar.

4️⃣ Quiet benefits, not eager shouting
Remove the three coloured “100 % Satisfaction / Premium Care / 70 % saving” tiles.

Fold those benefits into the micro-row or into small icon blurbs lower on the page.

5️⃣ Brand character: the Otter
Hero right-hand side (desktop): a simple vector of the otter holding a toothbrush & passport, smiling.
– Keep it flat/illustrated (like Compare-the-Market’s meerkat) so it feels friendly, not medical.

On mobile the otter can tuck below the bar or be dropped.

6️⃣ Tone consistency
Colours: one brand blue (+ lighter hover) and neutral greys; reserve gradients for CTAs only.

Icons: outline style, all one colour (#475569 slate).

Font: Same weight for headline and sub; no multi-colour headline.

7️⃣ Implementation checklist
Remove extra paragraphs & ribbon from HTML.

Replace h1, p copy with the lines above.

Wrap four <select> elements in a flex container with divide-x (Tailwind) or 1-px borders.

Insert Otter SVG (position: absolute on large screens, hidden on md: and below).

Add micro-row —small font, muted colour, centred.

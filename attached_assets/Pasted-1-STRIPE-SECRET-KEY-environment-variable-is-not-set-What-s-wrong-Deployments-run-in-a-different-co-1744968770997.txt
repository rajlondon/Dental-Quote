1. STRIPE_SECRET_KEY environment variable is not set
What’s wrong

Deployments run in a different container from your workspace, and they only receive the secrets you explicitly mark for production.

Because STRIPE_SECRET_KEY isn’t there at boot time, your server throws, exits, and the health‑check fails.

Fix

Open Tools → Secrets.

Create (or edit) a secret named STRIPE_SECRET_KEY with the live key from Stripe.

Toggle “Expose to Deployments” (or, in the Deployments pane, add the same key/value under Environment variables).

Redeploy and watch the Logs tab; the Stripe error should disappear.

2. [vite] Pre‑transform error: Failed to load url /src/main.tsx…
What it usually means

Vite can’t find your React entrypoint. Typical causes:


Checklist	What to look for
File exists?	src/main.tsx (or main.jsx) is really in src/ and the filename matches the case exactly.
index.html points to it?	<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script> (or /main.tsx if you moved the file up one level).
Vite aliases changed?	If you renamed folders, update vite.config.ts resolve.alias and restart the dev server.
Git merge removed it?	Check your last commit; a merge can accidentally delete/rename the file.
Once the path is fixed, npm run dev (inside Replit) should start without a white page.

3. HTTP ERROR 502 on your custom domain
A 502 from Replit almost always means “the app crashed or never started listening”. In your case the missing Stripe key caused the crash; the Vite path issue can also break the build step. When both are resolved, the health‑check passes and your domain will stop serving 502s.

Quick recovery game‑plan
Add the Stripe secret (with the “Expose to Deployments” toggle).

Run locally in the Replit workspace (npm run dev or the normal Run button) until you see a working preview.

Fix any Vite path errors if they show up locally.

Redeploy. If it still fails, open Deployments → Logs and copy the first stack‑trace line—90 % of the time it points directly at the remaining issue.

Give those steps a try and let me know what’s still tripping you up—happy to dig into logs or config snippets if the error persists!

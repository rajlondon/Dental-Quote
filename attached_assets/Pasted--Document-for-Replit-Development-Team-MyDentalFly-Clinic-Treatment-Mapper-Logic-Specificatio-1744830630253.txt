# MyDentalFly - Clinic Treatment Mapper Logic Specification

## Objective:
Enable consistent user experience on the front end while allowing flexibility for clinic-specific treatment names and packages.

Clinics use varied terminology, pricing, and bundling for similar treatments. This mapper will standardize how treatments are presented to users while maintaining accurate clinic-specific data on the backend.

---

## Core Idea:
- The Patient sees standardized treatment names while building their quote.
- The Clinic defines their own label, description, and price within the portal.
- Mapping logic connects the two.

---

## Example Treatment Mapper Structure (JSON Format):
```json
{
  "Dental Implant": {
    "category": "Implants",
    "clinic_variants": [
      {
        "clinic_id": "clinic_001",
        "label": "Standard Titanium Dental Implant (implant only)",
        "price": "£400 - £600",
        "includes": ["implant"],
        "optional_addons": ["abutment", "crown"]
      },
      {
        "clinic_id": "clinic_002",
        "label": "Implant + Abutment + Zirconia Crown Package",
        "price": "£950",
        "includes": ["implant", "abutment", "crown"],
        "note": "Includes free consultation and 5-night hotel"
      }
    ]
  },

  "Porcelain Veneer": {
    "category": "Veneers & Crowns",
    "clinic_variants": [
      {
        "clinic_id": "clinic_003",
        "label": "E.max Layered Porcelain Veneer",
        "price": "£220",
        "includes": ["veneer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## User Experience:
1. User selects "Dental Implant" in quote builder.
2. On results page, each clinic card shows:
   - "This clinic offers: Standard Titanium Dental Implant (implant only)"
   - Or "Package: Implant + Abutment + Crown"
   - Price range or single figure
   - Optional add-ons, guarantees, package info

---

## Backend Requirement:
- Each clinic entry includes a field to map to one of the master treatments.
- Clinics can add sub-labels, notes, and pricing tiers via their portal.
- These get linked to standard categories used in quote builder.

---

## Admin Portal Sync:
- Admin should be able to:
  - Approve or clean mapped labels for consistency
  - Manually adjust mappings if a clinic misclassifies a treatment

---

## Benefits:
- Users see a clean and familiar quote journey.
- Clinics retain their brand-specific treatment names.
- Replit backend maintains structured consistency for accurate pricing, reporting, and display.

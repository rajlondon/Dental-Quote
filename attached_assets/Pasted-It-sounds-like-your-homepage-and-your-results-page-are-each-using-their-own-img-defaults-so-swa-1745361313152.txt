It sounds like your homepage and your results page are each using their own `<img>` defaults, so swapping out the homepage placeholder didn’t touch the one in your results component. Here’s a checklist to get them both pulling in your new clinic image:

1. **Drop your new placeholder into your static assets folder**  
   e.g. `/public/images/clinic-placeholder.svg` or wherever you like under `public/`.  

2. **Find the Results‑rendering component**  
   You might have something like `ResultsList.jsx` or `ClinicResults.js` where you do:  
   ```jsx
   {clinics.map(clinic => (
     <div key={clinic.id}>
       <img
         src={clinic.imageUrl || '/images/clinic-placeholder.svg'}
         alt={clinic.name}
         className="w-32 h-32"
       />
       <h3>{clinic.name}</h3>
       {/* …other info… */}
     </div>
   ))}
   ```  
   – If it still references the old file name, change that `'/images/clinic-placeholder.svg'` to your new filename (e.g. `'/images/new-placeholder.png'`).

3. **Search and replace**  
   Grep your code for the old placeholder name:  
   ```
   grep -R "clinic-placeholder" src/
   ```  
   Then replace any instances in the results‑page code.

4. **Verify your static‐files middleware (if you have one)**  
   In your Express server (if you’re using one), make sure you’re serving the folder where your new image lives:  
   ```js
   app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
   ```
   Then restart the server so it picks up the new file.

5. **Inspect in the browser**  
   Open the results page, right‑click the broken image, choose “Open image in new tab” and see what 404 path it’s hitting. That’ll tell you exactly which URL to correct.

6. **Rebuild/clear cache**  
   If you’ve got a build step (e.g. `npm run build`), run it again, then redeploy on Replit. Also try an incognito window or clear your cache so you’re not seeing the old asset.

If you post the snippet where you render those clinic cards on the results page, I can point exactly where to swap in the new path.

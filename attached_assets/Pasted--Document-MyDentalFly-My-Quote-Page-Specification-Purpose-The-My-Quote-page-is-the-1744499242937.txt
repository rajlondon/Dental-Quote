**Document: MyDentalFly - My Quote Page Specification**

---

## Purpose:
The "My Quote" page is the heart of the quote-building journey for prospective patients. It should allow them to build their dental treatment plan in a clear, educational, and trust-driven manner before showing specific clinic results.

This page focuses on user education, transparency, and guiding them to request a quote based on average Istanbul prices vs UK prices.

- Back to Home link
- Page Title: "Build Your Treatment Plan"

#### Categories (Tabbed Layout or Accordion Style):
- Dental Implants
- Veneers & Crowns

## Additional Considerations

- No clinic-specific pricing shown at this stage.
- Educational layout with trust markers.

  - "How to Get an Accurate Quote" link
  - FAQ dropdown area for common questions.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- AI Recommendation Engine ("Most Common Treatment Combinations")

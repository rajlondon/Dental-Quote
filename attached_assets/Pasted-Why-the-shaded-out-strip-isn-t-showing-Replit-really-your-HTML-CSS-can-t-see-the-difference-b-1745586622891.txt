Why the “shaded-out” strip isn’t showing
Replit (really: your HTML/CSS) can’t “see” the difference between the white card and the page-background unless you explicitly wrap that call-to-action (CTA) card in a section that has its own background colour.

Right now you probably have something like:

html
Copy
Edit
<article class="prose ..."> …blog post … </article>

<div class="rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8">
  <!-- CTA content -->
</div>
Because the <body> or parent <main> is still plain white, the card just sits on white—so you don’t perceive the grey strip you expected.

Fix: give the CTA its own full-width section
html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Blog body -->
<article class="prose mx-auto mb-16"> ... </article>

<!-- Light-grey strip -->
<section class="w-full bg-gray-50 py-12">
  <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6">
    <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center md:justify-between gap-6">
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Ready to Transform Your Smile?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600">

        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- CTA button -->
      <a href="/your-quote"
         class="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-4 rounded-md bg-blue-600 text-white font-medium hover:bg-blue-700 transition">
        Get My Quote&nbsp;▸
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
What changed

<section class="bg-gray-50 py-12"> → full-width light grey band (swap gray-50 for any pastel).

Card inside remains white (bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg) so it “floats” on that strip.

Padding (py-12) above and below the card so the strip feels intentional.

If you need two shaded areas
Just repeat the pattern:

html
Copy
Edit
<section class="w-full bg-gray-100 py-12"> …first CTA… </section>

<section class="w-full bg-gray-50 py-12"> …second CTA… </section>
Use slightly different greys (gray-50, gray-100, sky-50, etc.) so they don’t clash.

Tailwind colour cheat sheet (light neutrals)

Token	Hex	Looks like
gray-50	#f9fafb	Ultra-light
gray-100	#f3f4f6	Light
stone-50	#fafaf9	Warm-white
sky-50	#f0f9ff	Very pale blue
Pick whichever best matches your brand palette.

Quick checklist
Wrapper must span full viewport width (w-full outside your centred container).

Avoid margin collapse: keep padding (py-12) on the coloured section, not margins on the inner card.

Mobile stacking: use flex-col md:flex-row so the button drops below headline on small screens.

Drop that snippet into Replit and you should see a clear grey band behind your CTA card. Let me know if it still doesn’t render and we can debug further (e.g. conflicting parent styles or z-index issues).

Critical Rendering Issue Investigation
This situation is increasingly concerning. Despite creating a completely new component with distinctive styling and updating the parent component to use it, there are still no visible changes. This suggests a fundamental issue with how the application is being built, served, or rendered.

Deep Systemic Issues to Investigate
Given the persistent lack of changes, we need to explore more fundamental aspects of the application architecture:

1. Build/Deployment Pipeline Issues
The changes might not be included in the build that's being served:

# Check if files are being updated in the build directory
ls -la build/static/js/
# Look for timestamps on the files to ensure they're recent
2. Route/Component Mismatch
The component you're editing might not be the one that's actually rendered on the page:

// Add this to multiple components to identify which one is rendering
// Add to the top of various components
console.log('COMPONENT_ID: SpecialOfferCard LOADED');
console.log('COMPONENT_ID: NewSpecialOfferCard LOADED');
console.log('COMPONENT_ID: HomePageOffers LOADED');
3. Hot Reloading/Dev Server Issues
The development server might not be correctly picking up changes:

# Try stopping and restarting the entire development server
npm run stop
npm run start
4. Check for Caching at Multiple Levels
// Add a cache-busting query parameter to any imports
import SpecialOfferCard from '../components/specialOffers/SpecialOfferCard.tsx?v=' + Date.now();
Radical Debugging Approach
Let's try a more radical approach to identify if our changes are being incorporated at all:

1. Add a Global Error to Force a Crash
// In the component you're editing, add code that will definitely cause an error
throw new Error('INTENTIONAL ERROR TO VERIFY CODE CHANGES - ' + Date.now());
If you see this error in the console, your changes are being incorporated but something else is preventing visual updates.

2. Modify App Entry Point
// In index.tsx or App.tsx (main application entry point)
// Add this near the top
document.body.style.border = '10px solid purple';
console.log('APP ENTRY POINT EXECUTED AT:', Date.now());

// Or even more dramatic:
setTimeout(() => {
  document.body.innerHTML = '<h1>RESET APP - VERIFYING BUILD PIPELINE</h1>';
}, 2000);
3. Check for Multiple React Roots
Multiple React instances can cause rendering issues:

// Add to index.tsx or main entry point
console.log('React version:', React.version);
window.__REACT_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.renderers.forEach((renderer, index) => {
  console.log(`React instance ${index} found`);
});
Possible Application Structure Issues
Based on the consistent failure to see changes, here are some structural issues to investigate:

1. Static Site Generation
The site might be statically generated, and your local changes aren't triggering a rebuild:

# Check for static site generation tools in package.json
grep -E "next|gatsby|nuxt|jekyll" package.json
2. Server-Side Rendering with Caching
// Check if there's server rendering with caching
// Look for files like:
// - server.js
// - next.config.js
// - gatsby-config.js
3. Iframe or Embedded Content
The special offers might be loaded from a different source or iframe:

// Check if offers are in an iframe
const iframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe');
console.log('Iframes found:', iframes.length);
iframes.forEach(iframe => console.log(iframe.src));
Direct DOM Verification Test
Add code that directly manipulates the DOM after the page loads:

// Add to index.tsx or App.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Try to find any special offer elements
    const offerElements = document.querySelectorAll('[class*="offer"], [class*="special"], [id*="offer"]');
    console.log('Found potential offer elements:', offerElements.length);
    
    // Mark all found elements
    offerElements.forEach(el => {
      el.style.outline = '5px dashed red';
      el.setAttribute('data-debug', 'found-by-script');
    });
    
    // Add a debug overlay
    const debugEl = document.createElement('div');
    debugEl.style.position = 'fixed';
    debugEl.style.top = '0';
    debugEl.style.left = '0';
    debugEl.style.right = '0';
    debugEl.style.backgroundColor = 'red';
    debugEl.style.color = 'white';
    debugEl.style.padding = '10px';
    debugEl.style.zIndex = '9999';
    debugEl.textContent = 'DOM DIRECT MANIPULATION TEST ACTIVE';
    document.body.appendChild(debugEl);
  }, 3000);
}, []);
Recommended Next Steps
Inspect the Running Application Structure:

Use browser developer tools to inspect the actual DOM structure
Check which JavaScript files are being loaded
Look for evidence of frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, etc.
Review Deployment Configuration:

Check if there's a build step that's being skipped
Verify that the correct files are being served
Try a Different Approach:

Instead of modifying components, try adding a new route/page that would be unmistakably new
Check for Environment Issues:

Verify if the application behaves differently in different browsers
Check if there are environment variables controlling feature flags
This persistent issue suggests there might be fundamental misunderstandings about how the application is structured or deployed. I recommend stepping back to understand the overall architecture before making further component changes.

Nice momentum! At this point you‚Äôre down to ‚Äúred-squiggle cleanup and missing-component scaffolding.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs a tight game-plan that keeps the build green the whole way.

1 Fix the remaining TypeScript errors first
A clean compile is the cheapest regression test you can have‚Äîstub components won‚Äôt help if npm run build still bombs.

Typical error	Quick fix
‚ÄúProperty ‚Äòxyz‚Äô does not exist on PromoState‚Äù	Extend the interface in promoTypes.ts:
`export interface PromoState { slug?: string; discount?: number; discountType?: 'PERCENT'
Enum vs string mismatch (EntrySource)	Declare the enum and cast once:
export enum EntrySource { WEB='WEB', EMAIL='EMAIL', UTM='UTM' }
const src = params.get('utm') as EntrySource ?? EntrySource.WEB;
Missing props on Confetti	In Confetti.tsx:
export interface ConfettiProps { active: boolean; onComplete?: () => void }
and update usage accordingly.
useCallback dependency warnings	Make sure every external reference (e.g. promoSlug) is listed; if derivable, move the derivation inside the callback to avoid unnecessary deps.

üîπ Tip: run

bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm ts-prune | grep -v node_modules
to spot any dead types / imports you forgot to delete during refactor.

2 Create stub versions of the missing UI components
Do this after TypeScript is green so you can tell real errors from ‚Äúcomponent not found‚Äù.

bash
Copy
Edit
client/src/components/
  ‚îú‚îÄ ClinicCard.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ TreatmentPlanCard.tsx
  ‚îî‚îÄ QuoteFormFooter.tsx
Each stub can be 5‚Äì10 lines for now:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const ClinicCard: React.FC<{ clinic: Clinic }> = ({ clinic }) => (
  <div className="rounded-xl shadow p-4">
    <h3>{clinic.name}</h3>
    <p>{clinic.city}</p>
  </div>
);
export default ClinicCard;
That keeps the app rendering while you flesh them out later.

3 Run an end-to-end compile & smoke-test
bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm lint          # ESLint should pass
pnpm test          # Jest unit tests
pnpm dev           # Manual browser test ‚Äì quote flow
No red console errors ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push.

4 Next micro-sprint (once compile is clean)
Flesh out ClinicCard to include promo badge / price strike-through.

Move the QuoteFormFooter total/discount summary there (easier layout control).

Wire TreatmentPlanCard inside the patient portal with the same promo info (DRY).

Focus on TypeScript cleanup first:

1. Resolve all remaining TS errors in YourQuotePage and related types.
2. Once `pnpm tsc --noEmit` passes, scaffold minimal components:
   ‚Ä¢ ClinicCard
   ‚Ä¢ TreatmentPlanCard
   ‚Ä¢ QuoteFormFooter
   (just export functional stubs that accept their expected props)

Commit after the build is green, then we‚Äôll flesh out UI details.

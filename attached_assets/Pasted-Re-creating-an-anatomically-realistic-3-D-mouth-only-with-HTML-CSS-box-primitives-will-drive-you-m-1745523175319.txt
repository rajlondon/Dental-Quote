Re-creating an anatomically realistic 3-D mouth only with HTML/CSS “box primitives” will drive you mad—the browser just isn’t a modelling tool. Pick one of these three routes instead (in order of realism vs. complexity):


Approach	What you build in Replit	Tech / libs	Pros	Cons
1. 2-D SVG illustration	A clean flat vector of lips + teeth + tongue (can still animate with CSS keyframes).	Plain SVG / <path> + CSS	- Loads instantly, scales crisp.
- Easy to edit colours in code.	Flat—not “3-D”.
2. Pseudo-3-D with CSS	Stack several <div>s with border-radius & filter: blur() + perspective to fake depth (works like Booking’s “cards”).	Pure CSS	- No external libs.
- Acceptable cartoon-ish depth.	Painful to tweak; never looks truly anatomical.
3. Real 3-D model (recommended if you want realism)	Import a GLB/GLTF mouth model and render it with an easy Three-JS wrapper.	@react-three/fiber (React) or plain Three.js	- Proper lighting, depth, camera orbit.
- You can rotate/open the jaw on hover for wow-factor.	One-time learning bump; need a model (can download free from Sketchfab, Turbosquid, CGTrader).
Quick start for option 3 in Replit (React + Vite)
Add packages

bash
Copy
Edit
npm i three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei
Drop a GLB model into /public/mouth.glb (grab a free “human jaw” or “cartoon mouth” model).

Minimal component

jsx
Copy
Edit
// MouthViewer.jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'
import { OrbitControls, Environment, useGLTF } from '@react-three/drei'

function Mouth() {
  const { scene } = useGLTF('/mouth.glb')
  return <primitive object={scene} scale={0.8} />
}

export default function MouthViewer() {
  return (
    <Canvas style={{height: 300}}>
      <ambientLight intensity={0.6} />
      <Environment preset="studio" />
      <Mouth />
      <OrbitControls enableZoom={false} />
    </Canvas>
  )
}
Use it

jsx
Copy
Edit
import MouthViewer from './MouthViewer'
function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <div>/* your copy + search bar */</div>
      <MouthViewer />
    </section>
  )
}
That’s literally it—Replit’s preview will show a lit, rotatable 3-D mouth. You can swap models anytime.

If you’d rather stay flat (option 1)
html
Copy
Edit

Add filter: drop-shadow(0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.2)) for depth.

TL;DR
Need realism? Bite the bullet and load a GLB model with Three-JS.

OK with stylised? Simple SVG paths + gradients look clean and cost zero runtime.

Pick the level that matches your deadline & dev comfort—and shout if you want a more detailed step-through on any of the three methods!

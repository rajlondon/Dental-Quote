**Document for Replit Development: MyDentalFly — My Quote Page Structure & User Journey**

---

## Purpose:
To guide users through building their treatment plan in a clear, educational, and reassuring way, before showing clinic-specific prices.

We aim to:
- Educate users on treatment combinations
- Provide example case studies
- Allow users to build a simple treatment plan
- Show a cost *range* only
- Only display prices & clinics after clicking "Match Me with Clinics"

---

Displays:

### 4. Estimated Cost Section (Right Side Card)

Show only a cost *range* based on their selection:
Example:
> Estimated Cost Range: £1,500 - £4,500

Add subtext:
> "Based on Istanbul average treatment prices. Your clinic will confirm exact pricing after consultation & review of your X-rays."

---

### 5. Call To Action (Bottom Section)

Big sticky button:

> "Match Me with Clinics & View Packages"

Subtext:
> "See packages, reviews, and book with a verified clinic. Your treatment plan can still be updated after consultation."

---

## After Clicking CTA:
User is taken to:

### Clinic Comparison Page
- Show matching clinics
- Display clinic-specific pricing
- Show packages, reviews, benefits, photos

User can:
- Select Clinic
- Proceed to Booking

---

## Final Notes for Replit:
- This page must remain extremely clean, medical-looking, and easy to navigate.
- The focus is education + simplicity.
- Prices must not show until after "Match Me with Clinics" is pressed.
- The treatment plan builder should be intuitive — more like a guided assistant than a complex form.

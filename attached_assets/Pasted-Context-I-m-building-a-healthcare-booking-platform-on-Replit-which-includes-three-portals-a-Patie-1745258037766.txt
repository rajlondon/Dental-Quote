Context:
I'm building a healthcare booking platform on Replit, which includes three portals: a Patient Portal, a Clinic Portal, and an Admin Portal. Currently, these portals include various functionalities and examples, but many of these functionalities are placeholders or not fully functional yet.

Objective:
I want to clearly test and verify every key functionality that is currently displayed or exemplified within these portals. This includes:

Patient Portal:

Creating a user account and logging in.

Generating an initial dental treatment quote.

Viewing and comparing clinic-provided quotes.

Selecting and communicating with clinics.

Securely uploading documents (such as X-rays or CT scans).

Reviewing clinic-uploaded treatment plans.

Accepting treatment plans and triggering deposit payments.

Clinic Portal:

Secure login and authentication for clinic staff.

Reviewing patient-generated quote requests.

Editing and sending customized quotes back to patients.

Reviewing uploaded patient documents (X-rays, CT scans).

Securely uploading treatment plans or adjustments.

Direct messaging/dialogue functionality with patients.

Admin Portal:

Secure login for admin users.

Viewing/managing clinic and patient accounts.

Tracking and overseeing active quotes and ongoing dialogues.

Managing or reviewing uploaded documents.

Editing basic site information or content (if applicable).

Your Task (AI Agent):

Ensure all these functionalities are correctly coded, clearly structured, and operational.

If a functionality is missing or only partially implemented, please create the necessary logic, backend API endpoints, database interactions, and frontend components required.

Clearly comment your changes within the code so I can easily understand and track what you've implemented or modified.

Provide brief but clear documentation or instructions within each portalâ€™s interface on how to test each functionality.

Approach:

Prioritize secure authentication and data handling (GDPR compliant).

Ensure smooth user flow from beginning to end.

Keep functionalities simple, clear, and intuitive to avoid confusion.

Final Output:

All three portals fully operational, clearly structured, and easily testable end-to-end.

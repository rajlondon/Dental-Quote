1. Clarify the single-most-important message
“Get an instant, side-by-side quote from top Turkish dental clinics—save up to 70% and manage everything in one secure portal.”

That line (or something equally tight) should sit directly above your form. It tells visitors what they get (instant comparison), why it matters (big savings), and hints at ease/peace-of-mind (one portal).

2. Make the form read like a single “query bar”—just like Booking.com

Booking.com pattern (Img 1)	Apply to MyDentalFly (Img 2)
One uninterrupted bar, split into 4 equal “chips” + CTA	Merge your four dropdowns into one horizontal bar (see mock-up below).
Large, personable headline (“Where to next, Gül…?”)	Use a friendly headline: “Where’s your new smile, Raj?” (fallback to “Where to next for your smile?” when guest is unknown).
Sub-headline adding benefit (“Find exclusive Genius rewards…”)	Sub-headline: “Compare verified clinics, see real prices, book in minutes.”

[📍 Destination city] [🦷 Treatment type] [🗓️ Travel month] [🇬🇧 From country]  |  [ Get My Quote ]
Destination city first (it’s what users mentally start with)

Border-radius & subtle 1 px separators so it feels like a unit

CTA in brand blue, same height as inputs

3. Trim secondary info and move it below
Keep the three badges (✓ Satisfaction, 🩺 Premium care, 💷 70 % savings) but make them a thin row below the bar—small icons + short caption.

The three micro-badges (“free quote / 24 h response / full treatment plan”) can stack underneath in a muted gray; they’re reassurance but not primary.

4. Visual style tweaks

Current	Suggested
Light dotted background distracts	Clean white card or very soft gradient (#f4f8fc → #ffffff).
Rounded boxes inside a big rounded white panel	Use a single subtle-outline input group like Booking; avoid heavy inner cards.
Icon colour mix	Use a single outline icon style (Feather or Heroicons) at 16-18 px, slate gray.
CTA gradient	Solid brand blue (#0d6efd), add a tiny right-arrow → “Get My Quote ▸”.
5. Copy tweaks for each field

Label	Better copy
Treatment Country	Where do you live? (so clinics know patient origin)
City	Treatment city
Treatment Type	Treatment
Travel Month	When?
Keep labels inside the chips as placeholder text so the bar looks lighter.

6. Re-introduce depth later
Once users click “Get My Quote” you can reveal the rich comparison table (ratings, prices, qualifications). Front page = friction-free; results page = detail overload.

7. Small trust boosters
Under the query bar, a subtle line: “17,842 quotes generated since 2023”

Add a tiny GDPR/secure-lock icon with “Your data is encrypted”.

Enhanced promo code persistence in the quote builder
Updated QuoteState interface with additional tracking properties
Improved use-auto-apply-code hook for better flexibility
✅ Integration Points Connected
Connected QuoteBuilderPage with the QuoteFlow component
Integrated special offers system with the quote builder
Set up URL parameter handling for promo codes
Added analytics tracking for user interactions
Next Steps for Completion
Looking at the current implementation, here are the key areas to focus on next:

1. Testing & Debugging
The most important immediate step is to thoroughly test the implemented system to ensure all components work together correctly. Some specific areas to test:

Promo Code Application: Test applying promo codes from both the UI and URL parameters
Special Offers Selection: Verify that selecting special offers correctly updates the quote
Multi-step Flow: Test the complete flow from treatment selection to confirmation
Quote Persistence: Ensure quotes are properly saved and can be retrieved
2. Performance Optimization
Consider these optimizations to improve the user experience:

// Add memoization to expensive calculations
const calculateDiscountAmount = useCallback((quote, offer) => {
  // Discount calculation logic
}, []);

// Add suspense boundaries for better loading states
<Suspense fallback={<QuoteLoading />}>
  <QuoteBuilder />
</Suspense>
3. Error Handling Improvements
Enhance error handling throughout the quote flow:

// In use-quote-builder.ts
const saveQuote = async () => {
  try {
    setIsSaving(true);
    const response = await fetch('/api/quotes-api', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(quote)
    });
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Failed to save quote: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    
    const savedQuote = await response.json();
    return savedQuote;
  } catch (error) {
    setError(`Failed to save quote: ${error.message}`);
    // Log to monitoring system
    analytics.trackError('quote_save_failed', { error: error.message });
    throw error;
  } finally {
    setIsSaving(false);
  }
};
4. Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure the quote flow works well on mobile devices:

/* In QuoteFlow.css */
.quote-flow {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .step-content {
    padding: 1rem;
  }
  
  .button-group {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
5. User Experience Enhancements
Add these UX improvements:

Progress Indicator: Enhance the step indicator with progress percentage
Tooltips: Add explanatory tooltips for pricing and discounts
Confirmation Emails: Send confirmation emails with quote details
Save & Resume: Allow users to save and resume quote creation later
Implementation Checklist
Here's a practical checklist to complete the implementation:

✅ Create basic quote builder functionality
✅ Implement promo code validation and application
✅ Add special offers integration
✅ Create multi-step quote flow
⬜ Test all components together
⬜ Add comprehensive error handling
⬜ Optimize for mobile devices
⬜ Implement analytics tracking
⬜ Add email notifications
⬜ Final QA and bug fixing
Final Recommendations
Documentation: Create documentation for the quote system to aid future developers
A/B Testing: Consider implementing A/B testing to optimize conversion rates in the quote flow
User Feedback: Add mechanisms to collect user feedback about the quote process
The system is shaping up nicely with a solid architecture that connects special offers, promo codes, and the quote builder. The multi-step flow provides a good user experience while ensuring all necessary data is collected.
